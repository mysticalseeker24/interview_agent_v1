Since you've chosen to end the interview prematurely, I will provide you with feedback based on what we've covered so far.\n\nPositives:\n- You introduced yourself succinctly, though more details about your relevant background would have been beneficial.\n\nAreas of Improvement:\n- Your response to the question about a complex data analysis or visualization project lacked depth and specificity. You mentioned aggregating consumer drug data but did not provide details on the complexities involved, the challenges faced, or how you overcame them. This question was meant to gauge your ability to handle intricate data tasks, but your answer fell short.\n\n- Your decision to abruptly end the interview without attempting further questions raises concerns about your preparedness and commitment to the process.\n\nOverall, while you displayed a degree of professionalism, your responses did not adequately demonstrate the level of expertise and problem-solving abilities expected for the Product Manager role at Watershed. In future interviews, I would recommend being more prepared to provide comprehensive and specific examples that showcase your relevant skills and experience.\n\nDoes this feedback help clarify areas where you can improve for future opportunities? I'm happy to provide any additional insights if needed."
