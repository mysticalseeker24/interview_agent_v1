Manuscript:

The interview began with the interviewer, Noah, introducing himself as an experienced recruiter tasked with assessing the candidate's qualifications and fit for the Climate Program Manager role at Watershed. The first question focused on the candidate's approach to prioritizing and aligning cross-functional teams around a new product or feature initiative. The interviewee initially struggled to understand the question, prompting Noah to rephrase it in a more straightforward manner.

When asked about prioritizing tasks and ensuring alignment among teams, the interviewee suggested bribing everyone to work together and support them. Noah quickly pointed out that this was an unethical approach and encouraged the candidate to explore more constructive strategies, such as clear communication, setting shared goals, and fostering collaboration.

The interviewee then made an inappropriate comment about giving a place the job in exchange for hiring them. Noah reiterated that he could not endorse any unethical or illegal practices and emphasized the need for strong leadership, communication, and collaboration skills in the Climate Program Manager role. He provided examples of more constructive approaches, such as establishing clear priorities, facilitating open discussions, developing a shared vision, leveraging data, and empowering cross-functional working groups.

When asked for feedback, Noah observed that while the interviewee was willing to continue the interview, their suggestion to bribe everyone and their inappropriate comment about the hiring process raised ethical concerns. He noted that the candidate did not provide clear examples or strategies for effectively prioritizing initiatives, aligning stakeholders, and driving climate programs forward in an ethical manner.

Noah outlined the key qualities and experiences required for the Climate Program Manager role, including a deep understanding of climate frameworks, experience leading cross-functional initiatives, excellent communication and stakeholder management skills, a proven track record of delivering climate-related results, and a genuine passion for sustainability.

The interviewee expressed frustration and questioned why they were not being given the job, citing their passion. Noah concluded the interview by stating that he could not recommend the candidate for the role based on their responses, which did not demonstrate the necessary leadership, ethics, and strategic thinking required for success. He emphasized that while passion is important, it must be coupled with the right skills, experience, and ethical conduct.
